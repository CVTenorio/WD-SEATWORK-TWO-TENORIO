              <h2>WHY EGGY?</h2>
              <p>The story why I became Eggy is, I had an experience that I needed to save up money so I think of a way that I can be full, so I started to  only eat eggs and have some cheese over it or in it. Eventually I had a friend noticed me that I was eating eggs all day, so that time she gave me nickname Egg man but I wanted my nickname to be shorter so I thought of Eggy.</p>
